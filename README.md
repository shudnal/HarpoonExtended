![](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/3667/images/headers/2528_1695185106.jpg)

There is no spoon. There is Harpoon.

And you need to get fun of it. You didn't know you needed this.

You're practically spiderman.

Please use with caution especially in multiplayer. The mod needs further testing.

## Basic features
* harpoon almost everything!
* pull harpooned target to yourself
* release the line
* harpoon target and pull yourself to it
* almost every basic aspect of physics is configurable
* server synced config

### Detailed features
* disable durability usage
* disable damage
* increase max quality and durability per lvl
* apply Feather Fall while harpooning to prevent fall damage
* control what objects is targetable
* by default terrain harpooning is disabled. It could be especially handy in mountains and mistlands.
* pulling Leviathans and Bosses was considered cheating and also disabled by default.

You can pull to every target if you hold "Pull to target mode" when harpoon hits the target. Pls keep in mind it's NOT Shift + attack but Shift must be hold at the moment harpoon hits.

That way you can pull yourself to moving objects. Attaching yourself to objects (like sitting) will break the line.


For any object that can not be moved you will be pulled to it.


### Besides obvios cases like terrain, rocks and trees there are special cases:
 * birds (seagulls and so). They are scripted to fly.
 * intentional pulling (special hotkey)
 * you can NOT pull the players only be pulled to it
 * ship or cart controlled by other player can not be pulled

## Hotkeys
### Default ones (you can't change it) are:
 * pull line - "Use" bind, default is E for keyboard
 * release line - "Crouch" bind + pull line bind, default is Ctrl + E for keyboard
 * stop harpooning - "Block" bind, default is right mouse button
 * Pull To Target mode - "Alternative placing" bind, default is Left Shift for keyboard
### Configurable ones:
 * pull line - T
 * release line - LeftControl + T
 * stop harpoon - LeftShift + LeftControl + T
 * Pull To Target mode - LeftShift

## Known issues
 * you can't pull a player. No you can NOT. Yes vanilla game have it. This mod does NOT. Maybe later.

## Potential issues
 * multiplayer may grant weird interactions (I couldn't test it properly yet so use with caution). It won't break your game but may kill you or fly you to the world edge.

## Configurating
The best way to handle configs is configuration manager. Choose one that works for you:
